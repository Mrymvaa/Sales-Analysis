# Sales-Analysis
In this project, I explored sales data to get insights and future predictions of sales.

# Questions to explore:
1.  What was the best month for sales? And how much was earned that month?
2.  What city sold the most product?
3.  What time is the best for purchasing the product?
4.  What are the most purchased products together?
5. 	What product is sold the most? 

# Conclusion of the analysis:
- Best month for sales was during December, where 4 billion dollars was earned.
- January is the worst month to have sales, where 1.8 billion dollars only. Which is really low compared 
to Decembers's earnings.
- San Francisco is the city with the largest sales.
- The city with the lowest sales is Austin.
- Best timings to purchase sales, according to the data, is between 11 am to 12 pm and 6 to 7 pm.
- Most sold products are Batteries.
- Most unsold products are the LG washing machine and LG dryer, might be due to the price?
- Products that are low in price are sold the most and products high in price are the least sold.
